# Gesture Recognizer
This is a gesture recognizer written in Python. Using Tensorflow we created a LSTM Neural Network which is trained on 3 gestures.
This can be extended to more gestures. We need to create training data for gestures and retrain the model.
The end goal is to cover the entire sign language.
## Requirements
Python 2.7 and the python packages are listed in requirements.txt  
run the following command in the terminal  
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
